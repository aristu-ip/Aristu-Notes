====== 2. Kant's Leibnizian Heritage ======
Created Tuesday 20 July 2021


* Leibniz background
	* All things in universe is composed of simple //monads// (the only 'real' things) 
		* Its simplicity implies its nonspatio-temporality
		* Intelligible entities, object of thoughts, noumenal entities
	* Physical objects is phenomenal manifestations
	* Reversing empiricist theory of ideas
		* Sense-perception is but a confused mode of intellection
* Leibniz's Relational Theory
	* Newton's space is unitellegible
		* N see space as non-substance (because no dynamical relations to one another) with properties (e.g. extension), but all properties are attached to substances
		* N's space as //infinite set of indistinguishable math points// is in violation of Identity of Indiscernibles
	* Space is but //set of all possible positions objects can occupy relative to one another//
		* It differs with Newton in that the possiblity of position presupposes actual objects
		* Hence empty space is possible, but Leibniz rejects empty space because of Principle of Plenitude
	* Confusion 
		* Newton's inconsistency
			* N considers change in dynamical state as criterion for change in real state, unclear relation though
			* All absolute motion should be correlated with dynamical change, but N law of motions associate force with accelaration only
		* Berkeley and Mach take different approach to Newton
			* Berkeley: D & K is independent but both necessary for motion, but force is still absolute (?)
			* Mach: collapsing both concept, relativising force & motion
		* Leibniz retains Newton's inconsistency
* Leibniz Metaphysics & Epistemology of Space
	* Monads have qualities
		* Changing states & The law of change
		* Concept of monad
	* Monads expressing the world
	* the logical priority of non-relational to relational properties
	* Hiearchy of monads
		* Different level of //distinctness// in consciousness
		* Perception & concept differ only by their degree of consciousness (transmitted to Kant)
	* The doctrine of 'well-founded phenomena'
		* Reality is the result of confused perception
		* Objective vs Subjective aspect
	* All knowledges begin with clear/general ideas
	* Space is //ideal//
		* Two process, extending the object & producing space
	* Recap
		* Berkeley, Mach, & Leibniz agree that
			* physical objects are independent and prior of space
			* absolute motion without relative motion is unintelligible
		* But, Leibniz goes beyond
			* space as ideal, (incomplete) representation of mind-independent substances
* Kant's Early Leibnizian Views
	* //Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1747)//
		* Relational analysis of space
		* Answering why space is in three dimension
	* //New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Knowledge (1755)//
	* //Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens//
