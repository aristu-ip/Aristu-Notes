* Space is transcendetally ideal, nessecary conditions for experience
	* Empirical reality of space means that appearing in space is universal and necessary property of all objects
	* Not abstraction from experience
	* Not illusion/fiction of the understanding
* Logical
	* conditions under which judgements about space are true
	* Empirical reality of space means that proposition 'all things are in space' is universally true
	* "all empirical judgments about specific things in space retain their truth"
* Mathematical/geometrical
	* Axioms of geometry are necessary true for appearances
	* Necessary conditions for geometrical thoughts

* Discussion on traditional distinction of primary/secondary qualities
	* Objectivity of primary qualities is their conformity to the universal and necessary structure of space in general
