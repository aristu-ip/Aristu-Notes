====== 2. The First Edition Definitions of Transcendental Idealism ======
Created Monday 19/07/2021 10:31


* Kant's own definiton of Transcendental Idealism in first //Kritik //seems to be inline with subjectivist interpretation
* Some scholars argue Kant revised it in second edition
	* Deleted definition
	* Second defnition, retained but with foot note
* In both definition Kant writes appearances as if they were distinct entities
* Not somekinf of dual-aspect theories
* Less subjectivist definition present when juxtaposing between transcendental realism, but still subjectivistic, because it still present things-in-themselves as hypothetical
* [[..\3._Transcendental_versus_Empirical_Idealism.txt|But does this definition alone justifies assertion that Kritik is subjectivistic?]]
