* Recap on empirical rality of space
	* space is universal and necessary form of experience
	* sufficient to preserve the truth of empirical judgments about space
	* necessary to maintain the truth of all mathematical judgements about space
	* and this universality & necessity is formal characteristics
	* **however**, there is another reading, stronger one
		* two level of affection:
			* things-in-themselves -> transcendental ego
			* empirical objects -> empirical ego
		* above point meant that empirical objects are entirely given hence independent of empirical ego
			* objects exist independently of empirical consciousness
		* //__empirical dualism__//
		* **problems**
			* contradictions with Aesthetic, space and time is still connected to empirical consciousness
			* replication of appearances
	* what kant mean by empirical dualism
		* there is objects outside me
		* heterogeneity between the representations of inner and outer sense
		* **however,** this doesn't mean that there is object independent of empirical consciousness, it just meant the appearances inside and outside are different
