* It is easy to conclude Kant's silent decade as struggle against Hume's skeptical idealism
* But, if it was so, why Kant always mentioned Descartes, not Hume, as the skeptical idealist?
* The simple answer is Kant doesn't think Hume is a skeptical idealist
* **Why?**
	* What Kant meant by skeptical idealism
		* "someone who doubts whether our representations correspond with their objects"
		* Since it is also possible our source of representations is our own imagination, not real object, we have reason to mistrust our own representations
		* "the skeptical idealist does not doubt the principle of causality in general"
	* Kant saw Hume as //transcendental realist//
		* Kant interpreted Hume as someone who (naively) thinks appearances & things in themselves are the same
		* He saw Hume as some trascendental realist who became empirical idealist (one who "accepts the transcendental realist’s standard of truth as the correspondence of appearances with things-inthemselves, and then doubts whether it is possible to satisfy such a standard")
		* What is the significance of this? 
	* Kant's limited reading of Hume's skepticism
		* "Kant writes as if Hume’s skepticism were essentially restricted to his doubts about the principle of causality."
		* Kant agreed that causality cannot be derived from experience, but he also argued further that it is also impossible for other a priori concept such as substance
* Kant's interpreation appear at odds with Hume's //Treatise// but not necessarily with Hume's //Ennquiry//
* **Kant's oddity with //Treatise//**
	* Hume defended skepticism regarding the senses
	* Hume extended his skepticism to other concepts (including substances)
	* Hume maintained geometry derived from experience
* Kant did not know the Treatise, **but "**Kant most likely knew one part of the Treatise after all: the final chapter of Book I" translated by Hamann in 1771
	* That said, no evidence of his reading
	* Even if he read, he probably not effected by it
* **Consequences for first //Kritik//**
	* Many scholars interpret Transcendental Deduction as response to Hume's skepticism
	* Kant's target is Descartes
