* Kant's 1760s-1770s lectures show his ambivalent skeptical attitude towards idealism
* He attempts new tactics, but he also at times stressed that they had to be rejected not on theoritical grounds, rather on moral ones
* //Metaphysik Herder//
	* Kant actually defended Berkeley against common objections
	* He argued it's impossible to refute him on logical grounds
	* Impossibility of refuting egoism: our representations is equally probable to arise from imagination
* This shows Kant's declining confidence in Reason (departing from his most Rationalist works //Nova dilucidatio// and //Inaugural Dissertation//) in mid 60s-70s
* That said, he never really abandoned it completely either
* //Tr√§ume einers Geistersehers (1766)//
	* Impossibility of affirming certain existence without evidence from experience
		* Reason is tools to see logical relations between propositions
		* Not determening what exist
	* Necessary to differentiate between logical & real grounds of things
		* Real: experience
		* Logical: analysis of subject
	* **Conclusion**:
		* It is impossible to disprove idealism because it's not determined by experience
		* It is impossible to demonstrate that our representations come from external cause
* **Apparent contradictions**
	* If this reservations existed why Critical Kant affirmed things-in-themselves or rather attempt to refute idealism?
	* Kant's reservation was against the dogmatic way of affirming reality of things-in-themselves
		* Hence Critical Kant is more transcendental: only showing hoe one form of experience involves another
	* Interpertation of //Kritik// in stronger sense would yield inconsistencies
* Kant continues opposing idealism (even though also abandoning direct realism) by stressing //the coherence of our representations//
