====== 3. Transcendental versus Empirical Idealism ======
Created Monday 19/07/2021 10:42

* Not the case: upon wider context, Kant is criticizing subjectivism
* **Empirical (Material) Idealism**
	* "existence of objects in space outside us is either (a) doubtful and indemonstrable (Descartes) or (b) false and impossible (Leibniz & Berkeley)"
	* "Empirical" because of denying the reality of //empirical// world
* //Kantâ€™s distinction between two senses in which an object exists outside us//
	* Transcendental sense (beyond consciousness)
	* Empirical sense (in space) -> empirical idealism denies this
	* **Advantages**
		* Things in space are not illusion/false (dogmatic idealism)
		* Things in space are not perhaps an illusion/false (problematic idealism)/phenomenalism
		* Things in space doesn't exist in transcendental sense (transcendental realism)
			* "demands the impossible: proof of transcendental externality"
	* Kant's theory accomodates illusion vs real in empirical sense
* "empirical idealist shares a fatal premise with the transcendental realist: that to know something in space outside us //we must know whether our representations correspond with things-in-themselves//"
	* But we can't do this, since in order to compare tit-rep, we need to go beyond our own representations which is impossible
