====== Ch 3. The First Edition Refutation of Skeptical Idealism ======
Created Wednesday 21 July 2021

1. **__The Priority of Skeptical Idealism__**

* Skeptical idealist: Descartes
* Dogmatic: Leibniz
* Both, but more on skeptical/problematic idealist in the first edition
* Kant demote Dogmatic idealism because of its mystic vibes and value skeptical idealist more because it demmand more proof

2. **__The Critique of the Fourth Paralogism__**
* Kant omitted A 367-380 in the second edition
* Against Descartes, mainly, the doctrine that //we have immediate knowledge of our own inner states//
* Kant's digest of SI
	* that whose existence can be inferred only as a cause of given perceptions has only a doubtful existence
	* the existence of outer appearances cannot be immediately perceived, but can be inferred only as the cause of given perceptions
	* **ergo,** the existence of all objects of outer sense is doubtful
* //sophisma figurae dictionis (the fallacy of ambiguous middle)//
	* premises are correct, but conclusion valid only because the middle term is ambious
	* the ambiguous middle term is: outer appearence
		* which construed in both empirical and transcendental sense
* Kant accepts first premise, but questions second premise
	* it is true if "outer" here meant in transcendental sense
	* it is false if "outer" here meant in empirical way
		* remember empirical object are part of consciousness
		* "the reality of outer appearances will be given with the representations themselves"
* In the end, what's wrong with SI is faulty premise of transcendental realism
--------------------

3. **__The Proof of the External World__**
* Premises
	* It is certain that I have representations
	* External objects consist only in representations
	* **Ergo**, It is certain external objects exist
* The point being //inner sense-outer sense// is the same
* "The immediate testimony of self-consciousness"
	* Though problematic because we can have illusion
	* The reply to this is â€œWhatever is connected with a perception according to empirical laws is actual"
		* Transcendental idealist only need to compare appearances to appearances
		* Unlike transcendental realist
--------------------

4. **__A Cartesian Reply__**
* //__A cartesian__// would say
	* The question is not wether we have //representations//, but why there is three-dimensional objects existing //independent //of those representations
	* Kant solution seems to forfeit the independent reality of objects
* //Kant's// reply would be
	* Cartesian demand for independent reality rest upon false presupotition
	* Comparison between appearances is enough for determining 'reality' vs. illusion
* //__A cartesian__// would reply
	* We need more than internal coherence
	* We need correspondence
	* Even if we accept Kantian categories, we still can't know wether this categories itself not a kind of illusion by some genium malignum 
* //Kant// would concede, yes, and say
	* But, even if the structure doesn't correspond to things-in-themselves, it doesn't mean that all propositions inside the structure are false
	* Cartesian doubt doesn't matter
* **In short//, //**//Cartesian //confuses two level of discourse, empirical and transcendental
--------------------

5. **__Appearances and Spatiality__**
* "how is it possible for transcendental idealism to explain the empirical reality of things in space if it identifies these things with representations, which cannot be threedimensional?"
* "because things in space are threedimensional, whereas ideas or representations have no length, breadth, or depth ... Must we then conclude that spatiality is an illusion after all?"
* **To what does Kant ascribe spatiality?**
* Distinguish two aspects of representations: //state //and //object//
	* But what is this //object//? For it it's mental, it can't be 3d
* Distinguish two senses - empirical & transcendental - of apearance
