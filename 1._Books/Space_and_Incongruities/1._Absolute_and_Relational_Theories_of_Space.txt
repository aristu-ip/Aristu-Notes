====== 1. Absolute and Relational Theories of Space ======
Created Tuesday 20 July 2021

* 1768
* Leibniz -> Newtonian -> Murky
	* Some ppl say Kant abandoned it, some as transitory state, etc
* Buroker's arguments:
	* reject the relational theory of space
	* repudiate the epistemology of Leibniz
* Absolute space
	* Immutable, unmovable, absolutely indifferent to all matter
	* Infinite and uniform (not in the sense of homogeniety but in the sense that it has no structure which infuences bodies at all)
	* Absolute & Relative motion
		* We can't sense absolute motion though
		* How to differentiate between true/absolute motion & relative/apparent motion?
			* __properties, causes (useless)__
			* __effects (only accelaration)__
				* Newton's bucket arguments
					* 4 stages
						* 1st stage: bucket moves, water doesn't //(at moves relatively)//
						* 2nd stage: bucket & water moves //(at rest relatively)//, water concaved
						* 3rd stage: bucket stopped, water moves, still concave //(at moves relatively)//
						* 4th stage: all stops //(at rest relatively)//, water returns to normal 
					* What makes water concaved in stage 2 & 3?
						* Can't be relative motion because no such motion in stage 2
						* But it must have real cause!
						* The only alternative is absolute motion of the water
					* Inconsistency with second law of motion
						* Forces are proportional to the acceleration, not motion
						* Hence, uniform motion in absolute space wouldn't cause forces
* Relational Space
	* Berkeley: ideas of space/motion should be defined by reference to particular sensible objects, since all meaningful ideas are derived from the perceptions of sensible qualities
	* Three idea
		* Newton's absolute space stands for nothing
			* No genuine qualities, just privations os sensible objects' attributes
		* We can't even represent absolute space
		* What we have is sense of pure (not absolute) space
	* Motion is just relation
	* Two conditions for motion
		* Changing relative positions
		* Forces to the subject
