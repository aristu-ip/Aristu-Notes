* The issues
* {{.\pasted_image.png}}\
* **Transcendental Idealism **vs **Transcendental Realism**
	* **Transcendental Realism: **the view that obects in space and time exist indenpendently of our experience
		* Common prejudice
		* Common but fallacious presupposition
* **Empirical Idealism**
	* Assumes proper reality of //space outside us, b//ut denies our immediate knowledge of it
	* "the view that all we know immediately (non-inferentially) is the existence of our own minds and our temporally ordered mental states, while we can only infer the existence of objects “outside” us in space."
	* Because attributing effect to unknown cause is uncertain, this concludes in we cannot know objects outside us //in space//
	* **Dogmatic Idealism**
		* Objects in space do not exist
	* **Problematic Idealism**
		* Objects in space may exist, but we can't be sure
